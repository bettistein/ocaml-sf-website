# About us

The actions of the OCaml Software Foundation are directed by an
Executive Committee which currently consists of

- [Damien Doligez](http://pauillac.inria.fr/~doligez/)
  (advisor)

  (advisor)
- [Yann RÃ©gis-Gianas](http://yann.regis-gianas.org/)
  (representative of the teaching community)
- [Gabriel Scherer](http://gasche.info/) (president)

We regularly discuss our actions, internally, with an Advisory Board
consiting of representants of each of our sponsors -- see how to
[become a sponsor](becoming-a-sponsor.html).

Magali Fitzgibbon and Norma Caillot, employees of the INRIA
Foundation, provide the administrative and legal support that make our
actions possible.
